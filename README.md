# Mother-AI-Discord-Bot

A general purpose Discord bot which aims to feel like a human when interacting. Functionalities include:

  - Saving messages you write
  - Saving any existing messages from reply
  - Saving any existing messages from message link (if bot can reach it)
  - Sending messages from saved messages database
  - Deleting messages from saved messages db if you are the quoted user

  - Ultimate Ability The Forbidden Command (That all people love to spam)
    - When Called, Looks at the dates of the channels first and last messages
    - Picks a totally random date around the range until it finds messages that fit the filters you set up(attachments, links, images, youtube videos, and more) 
- A small possibility to inspire you by
  - Sending quotes from an API (example: Mother. please drop some WISDOM sheesh)
- Being annoying (or useful) by giving you stylized weather info whenever you mention a word like "weather"
  - Randomly formed response 
  - Weather info from literally every city known to google
  - Can detect multiple cities in your message
- Keeping track of crypto mining efficiency through hiveos and alert system

### list of some commands:<br/>
*(most commands are case insensitive, so.. freedom to interact with this bot with caps on if you want to SCREAM)*<br/>
*(some commands can be used with words around them. You can actually communicate to this bot your own way if you want to)*<br/>
*(vdq stands for "very deep quotes")*
- "Mother.newvdq" or "Mother. yaz bunu" to add a quote
- "Mother. sil 10" or "mother. delete 10", etc. to delete quote at index 10
- "mother.list.vdq" to list all custom quotes
- "Mother. özlü söz" or "mother. feed me with a deep quote" to get random vdq 
- etc.

- Magical function: Mother.forbidden<br/>
  - Reposts a random media from channel history. *Surprize*
  - "mother.forbidden.settings" enables you to select between options like "youtube", "imgur", message attachments or text messages that includes links

- Learn more about the Custom Status functionality with the command mother.customstatus (by default it's changing every couple minutes)
